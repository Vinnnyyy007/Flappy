Flappy Pwn
A hacker-themed twist on the classic flapping bird game. You are a data packet trying to infiltrate a secure network, navigating through firewalls and using exploits to achieve the highest score.

Gameplay
The goal is to navigate your packet through pairs of firewalls without crashing. Each firewall you pass increases your "ACCESS LVL" (score).

Controls
SPACE: Inject Packet (Flap) / Start Game

P: Pause / Resume

ESC: Quit Game

Exploits (Power-ups)
Collect these special items that appear between firewalls to gain temporary advantages:

Shield (Blue): Protects you from one crash.

Lag Exploit (Orange): Slows down the game speed.

Cloak (Purple): Shrinks your packet, making it easier to navigate.

Endless Ranking System
Instead of a finite goal, the game features an endless ranking system. Prove your skills by reaching higher ranks as your score increases.
