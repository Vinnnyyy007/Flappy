Flappy Pygame
A feature-rich clone of the classic Flappy Bird game built with Python and Pygame. This project goes beyond the basics, adding dynamic difficulty, power-ups, sound effects, and player rewards to create a more engaging experience.


Features
This isn't just a simple clone. Here are some of the features that make this version unique:

Classic Gameplay: Simple one-button (spacebar) flap controls with familiar gravity physics.

Dynamic Difficulty: The game speed subtly increases as your score gets higher, keeping the challenge fresh.

Moving Pipes: Some pipes will move up and down, requiring extra timing and attention.

Power-Ups: Collect special items that appear between pipes:

Shield: Protects you from a single crash.

Slow-Mo: Temporarily slows down the game speed.

Shrink: Makes the bird smaller, allowing it to fit through tighter gaps.

Rewarding Progression:

Medal System: Earn Bronze, Silver, or Gold medals on the game-over screen for reaching score milestones (10, 25, 50+ points).

Persistent High Score: Your high score is saved locally in a highscore.txt file, so you can always aim to beat your personal best.

Polished Experience:

Generated Sound Effects: All sounds for flapping, scoring, crashing, and power-ups are generated in real-timeâ€”no audio files needed!

Day/Night Cycle: The background smoothly transitions from day to night as your score increases.

Pause Function: Press the 'P' key at any time to pause the game.

How to Play
Start: Press the SPACEBAR to begin the game from the main menu.

Flap: Press the SPACEBAR during gameplay to make the bird flap upwards.

Pause: Press the 'P' key to pause or unpause the game.

Goal: Navigate through as many pipes as possible to get the highest score.
