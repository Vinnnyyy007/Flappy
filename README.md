🐧 Flappy Pwn — Hacker-Themed Flappy Bird
A hacker-themed twist on the classic flapping bird game.
You are a data packet trying to infiltrate a secure network, navigating through firewalls and using exploits to achieve the highest score.


🎮 Gameplay
The goal is to navigate your packet through pairs of firewalls without crashing.
Each firewall you pass increases your ACCESS LVL (score).


🕹️ Controls
Key	Action
SPACE	Inject Packet (Flap) / Start
P	Pause / Resume
ESC	Quit Game
🧰 Exploits (Power-ups)


Collect these special items that appear between firewalls to gain temporary advantages:


🛡️ Shield (Blue) — Protects you from one crash.

🐢 Lag Exploit (Orange) — Slows down the game speed.

🕵️ Cloak (Purple) — Shrinks your packet, making it easier to navigate.

🏆 Endless Ranking System


Instead of a finite goal, the game features an endless ranking system.
Prove your skills by reaching higher ranks as your score increases.
